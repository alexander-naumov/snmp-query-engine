# NAME

snmp-query-engine - multiplexing SNMP query engine

# VERSION

This document describes snmp-query-engine version 0.1

# SYNOPSIS

snmp-query-engine

# DESCRIPTION

XXX

# OPTIONS

XXX

# REQUESTS

All requests are arrays of at least two elements.
The first element must be a request type
represented by a small positive integer:

1. SETOPT
2. GETOPT
3. INFO
4. GET
5. GETTABLE

The second element must be a request id,
represented by a positive integer.
It is a good idea for every request within
a single client session to have a unique
request id, although request ids may
be reused - provided that the previous
request with the same id is no longer
active (that is, the client already
got a response).

The rest of request parameters are
request type-specific, and are described below.

All responses will be an array
of at least two elements.  The first
element will be the request type ORed
with either 0x10 to indicate a successfull
reply, or with 0x20 to indicate an error.
The second element will be the request id.
In case of an error, the third, and last,
element will be a textual description
of the error.  In case of a successfull
reply, the rest of response array
elements are request type-specific,
and are described below.

## SETOPT

The SETOPT request allows the client
to change per-destination options.
Please note that options are specific
for a destination, and not for a client
session, so that other clients making
requests towards the same destination
will also be affected.

SETOPT parameters:

- destination IP (v4 only) address in a dot-decimal notation
- destination port number
- a map of options

The map of options may contain any
number of supported options, including zero,
in which case SETOPT is exactly equivalent
to GETOPT.

Supported options:

- `version`  
SNMP version, 1 for SNMP 1, 2 for SNMP 2c;  default is 2.
- `community`  
SNMP community;  default is "public".
- `max_packets`  
Maximum number of SNMP packets to the destination being "on the wire"
at any given time.  The `snmp-query-engine` will avoid sending
any new SNMP requests exceeding this number
until getting a reply or a timeout.  The default is 3.
- `max_req_size`  
Maximum SNMP request packet size in bytes,
not counting IP and UDP headers.  Any request
which would exceed this size will be split
into smaller pieces.  Conversely, if there
are pending several small requests from the same
client towards the same destination, they may
be combined into a single SNMP request.
The default is 1400.
- `timeout`  
Time, in milliseconds, after which the SNMP
request will be re-sent (up to a configurable
number of retries).  The default is 2000 (XXX which is probably too little).
- `retries`  
Number of times a request will be re-sent (including the first
send), after which a timeout will be returned to the client.
The default is 3.
- `min_interval`  
Time, in milliseconds, that must pass between
subsequent SNMP queries towards the destination.
The default is 10.
- `max_repetitions`  
How many OIDs shall the destination return
in a single reply when requesting a table
using SNMP 2c.  This can be overridden
by individual GETTABLE requests.  The default is 10.

SETOPT reply will consist of a single map
with all current option values
for a given destination.

## GETOPT

The SETOPT request allows the client
to query per-destination options.

GETOPT parameters:

- destination IP (v4 only) address in a dot-decimal notation
- destination port number

GETOPT reply will consist of a single map
with all current options for a given destination
(see SETOPT parameters for options description).
