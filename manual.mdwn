# NAME

snmp-query-engine - multiplexing SNMP query engine

# VERSION

This document describes snmp-query-engine version 0.1

# SYNOPSIS

snmp-query-engine

# DESCRIPTION

XXX

# OPTIONS

XXX

# REQUESTS

All requests are arrays of at least two elements.

parameter 0
:   The first element must be a request type
    represented by a small positive integer:
    1 (**SETOPT**), 2 (**GETOPT**), 3 (**INFO**), 4 (**GET**), 5 (**GETTABLE**).

parameter 1
:   The second element must be a **request id**,
    represented by a positive integer.
    It is a good idea for every request within
    a single client session to have a unique
    request id, although request ids may
    be reused - provided that the previous
    request with the same id is no longer
    active (that is, the client already
    got a response).

The rest of request parameters are
request type-specific, and are described below.

All responses will be an array
of at least two elements.  The **first
element** will be the request type ORed
with either 0x10 to indicate a successfull
reply, or with 0x20 to indicate an error.
The **second element** will be the **request id**.
In case of an error, the third, and last,
element will be a textual description
of the error.  In case of a successfull
reply, the rest of response array
elements are request type-specific,
and are described below.

## SETOPT

The **SETOPT** request allows the client
to change several per-destination
and per-destination/client options.

Please note that setting values for options that are specific
for a destination, and not for a destination/client
session, will affect other clients
making requests towards the same destination.

SETOPT parameters:

parameter 2
:   destination IP (v4 only) address in a dot-decimal notation

parameter 3
:   destination port number

parameter 4
:   a map of options

The map of options may contain any
number of supported options, including zero,
in which case SETOPT is exactly equivalent
to GETOPT.

Supported options:

**`version`**
:   SNMP version, 1 for SNMP 1, 2 for SNMP 2c;  default is **2**.
    This is a per destination/client option which does
    not affect other clients.

**`community`**
:   SNMP community;  default is **"public"**.
    This is a per destination/client option which does
    not affect other clients.

**`max_packets`**
:   Maximum number of SNMP packets to the destination being "on the wire"
    at any given time.  The `snmp-query-engine` will avoid sending
    any new SNMP requests exceeding this number
    until getting a reply or a timeout.  The default is **3**.
    This is a per destination option which affects other clients.

**`max_req_size`**
:   Maximum SNMP request packet size in bytes,
    not counting IP and UDP headers.  Any request
    which would exceed this size will be split
    into smaller pieces.  Conversely, if there
    are pending several small requests from the same
    client towards the same destination, they may
    be combined into a single SNMP request.
    The default is **1400**.
    This is a per destination option which affects other clients.

**`timeout`**
:   Time, in milliseconds, after which the SNMP
    request will be re-sent (up to a configurable
    number of retries).  The default is **2000** (which is probably too little).
    This is a per destination/client option which does
    not affect other clients.

**`retries`**
:   Number of times a request will be re-sent (including the first
    send), after which a timeout will be returned to the client.
    The default is **3**.
    This is a per destination/client option which does
    not affect other clients.

**`min_interval`**
:   Time, in milliseconds, that must pass between
    subsequent SNMP queries towards the destination.
    The default is **10**.
    This is a per destination option which affects other clients.

**`max_repetitions`**
:   How many OIDs shall the destination return
    in a single reply when requesting a table
    using SNMP 2c.  This can be overridden
    by individual GETTABLE requests.  The default is **10**.
    This is a per destination option which affects other clients.

**SETOPT** reply will consist of a single map
with all current option values
for a given destination and client.

## GETOPT

The **GETOPT** request allows the client
to query per-destination and per-destination/client
options.

GETOPT parameters:

parameter 2
:   destination IP (v4 only) address in a dot-decimal notation

parameter 3
:   destination port number

**GETOPT** reply will consist of a single map
with all current options for a given destination
(see **SETOPT** parameters for options description).

## INFO

The **INFO** request returns global and connection statistics.
It has no extra parameters.

**INFO** reply will consist of a map with two keys, **connection**
and **global**.  The values associated with those keys are
themselves maps with, respectively, connection and global
stats.

The following statistics are available *for connection*:

**`active_cid_infos`**
:   number of GET and GETTABLE requests in progress for this connection

**`active_cr_infos`**
:   number of destinations queried during this connection
